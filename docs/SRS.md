## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the AWS S3 Manager Web Interface, a production-grade application for managing Amazon S3 buckets and objects through a modern web interface.

### 1.2 Scope
The AWS S3 Manager provides a comprehensive web-based interface for:
- Managing S3 buckets (create, delete, configure)
- Object operations (upload, download, delete, copy, move)
- Access control management
- Monitoring and analytics
- Multi-authentication support (AWS CLI, AWS SSO)

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service
- **SSO**: Single Sign-On
- **CLI**: Command Line Interface
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **UI**: User Interface
- **ACL**: Access Control List
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management

### 1.4 References
- AWS S3 API Documentation
- AWS SDK Documentation
- Kubernetes Documentation
- Material Design Guidelines

- **Bucket Management**: Full CRUD operations on S3 buckets
- **Object Management**: Upload, download, delete, copy, and move objects
- **Search and Filter**: Advanced search capabilities across buckets and objects
- **Access Control**: Manage bucket policies, ACLs, and IAM permissions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics, usage analytics, and audit logging
- **Authentication**: Support multiple authentication methods
- **API Access**: RESTful API for programmatic access

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **System Administrators**: Full access to all features
- **Developers**: Access to specific buckets and development resources
- **Read-Only Users**: View-only access to buckets and objects
- **Auditors**: Access to logs and audit trails

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile**: Responsive design for tablets and smartphones
