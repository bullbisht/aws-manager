## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - API Implementation Complete

This major release completes the core API implementation for the AWS S3 Manager, providing a fully functional REST API with authentication, validation, and comprehensive documentation. The application now has:

- **8 complete API endpoints** covering authentication and S3 operations
- **JWT authentication** with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Middleware protection** for route security
- **TypeScript integration** across frontend and backend
- **Interactive testing interface** for development
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples and guides

The next phase will focus on integrating real AWS S3 operations to replace the current mock data responses.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd s3-manager
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Test APIs interactively
open http://localhost:3000/api-test

# View documentation
open docs/API_ROUTES_DOCUMENTATION.md
```

### Migration Notes

Projects upgrading from v0.2.0 should:
1. Update API client usage to new endpoint structure
2. Update authentication flow to use new JWT system
3. Review and update any custom middleware or route handling
4. Test all functionality with the new API endpoints

For detailed migration instructions, see `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.
